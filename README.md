The latest resease of pygame is for python2.7, but it doesn't work with the 32-bit binary in Mac.
Solution:
	The Python 2.7.3 .dmg Mac OS installer installs both 64-bit and 32-bit binaries in: /Library/Frameworks/Python.framework/Versions/2.7/bin/

	There is a 32-bit binary called python2.7-32 in that folder.
	To use it in the Terminal simply type $ python2.7-32 instead of python
