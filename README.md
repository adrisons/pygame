	The Mac's system python's are in /System/Library/....
	.dmg's downloaded and installed from python.org are placed in /Library/....
	Don't delete the /System ones, but the /Library ones are user installed, so they should be safe to delete.

Install pygame: http://pygame.org/download.shtml

Execute pygame:
The latest resease of pygame is for python2.7, but there's only a 32-bit binary for Mac.
Solution:
	The Python 2.7.3 .dmg Mac OS installer installs both 64-bit and 32-bit binaries in: /Library/Frameworks/Python.framework/Versions/2.7/bin/
	There is a 32-bit binary called python2.7-32 in that folder.
	To use it in the Terminal simply type $ python2.7-32 instead of python
